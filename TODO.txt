TODO software-wise: 
Obstacle Avoidance (Anders working on this)
Ball Selection Optimization(Smartly select what ball the robot should currently pursue)(Maybe?)
When and how to switch from normal ball pursuing behavior to "ball close to corner" behavior (Using grabber helper etc.) (Probably good to use the state machine
to change into specific state altering robot behavior specifically to get ball from corner)(Christian working on this)
Counter to count nr of balls collected? (Only if tube can't hold all balls)
Interpolation (Simon working on this)
Optimization of the basic robot movement that takes robot from A to B, aka the PID (Try optimizing how fast/slow it turns and drives etc.) 
Testing of robot missing corner calculations (Possibly by visualization).
Error handling(Prevent program from crashing). Program crashes in several different scenarios, known ones are:
    1) robot corners blocked from camera
    2)
Test whether robot can do hand-in of many balls (6-8+) or if it stops the grabber early. (If it does, it might be due to balls reappearing and the robot switching back to collection mode)


TODO Imagerecognition-wise:
Take more pictures to make model better. OBS: include pictures with balls very close to cross. Include pictures with balls partially covered.
Test accuracy and speed of different models, f.eks. large vs medium model, or model trained on 200 epochs vs model trained on 100.
