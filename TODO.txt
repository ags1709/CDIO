TODO software-wise: 
Obstacle Avoidance (Anders working on this)
Ball Selection Optimization(Smartly select what ball the robot should currently pursue)(Maybe?)
When and how to switch from normal ball pursuing behavior to "ball close to corner" behavior (Using grabber helper etc.) (Christian working on this)
Sensor to detect when ball is collected? (Maybe. If tube can't hold all balls)
Interpolation (Simon working on this)
Optimization of the basic robot movement that takes robot from A to B, aka the PID (Try optimizing how fast/slow it turns and drives etc.) 


TODO Imagerecognition-wise:
Take more pictures to make model better. OBS: include pictures with balls very close to cross. Include pictures with balls partially covered.
