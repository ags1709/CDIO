TODO software-wise: 
Obstacle Avoidance
Ball Selection (Smartly select what ball the robot should currently pursue. Probably just closest ball?)
Goal calculation from image detection of boundaries
Navigate to goal
When and how to switch from ball collection to ball hand-in
When and how to switch from normal ball pursuing behavior to "ball close to corner" behavior (Using grabber helper etc.)
Sensor to detect when ball is collected? (Maybe)
