TODO software-wise: 
Obstacle Avoidance
Ball Selection Optimization(Smartly select what ball the robot should currently pursue)(Maybe?)
When and how to switch from normal ball pursuing behavior to "ball close to corner" behavior (Using grabber helper etc.)
Sensor to detect when ball is collected? (Maybe. If tube can't hold all balls)
Interpolation


TODO Imagerecognition-wise:
Take more pictures to make model better. OBS: include pictures with balls very close to cross. Include pictures with balls partially covered.
